# RAII Design Pattern in C++

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII, is a C++ programming technique which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object.
